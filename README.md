# Bankist

This is a mock banking application. This project was created as part of [The Complete Javascript Course  2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by *Jonas Schmedtmann*.

During the course, we developed both the main marketing website and the actual banking application as separate projects.

Here I have integrated both into an application that takes the user all the way from the sign up to transferring money between accounts.

The HTML/CSS foundation was mostly created by the course instructor. The Javascript was all written by me. The foundation of the program was written alongside the instructor as part of the course, but there is a good portion that I added to combine the two projects.
